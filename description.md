After setting up the AWS CLI, I used the provided Terraform module as a submodule in my root module to deploy an AWS Lambda function with the specified web scraper code. I structured my project with 'iac' and 'src' folders and followed our naming conventions using the locals block, ensuring I avoided hardcoding values by utilizing variables. I pushed the code to a remote repository, setting up a suitable .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files like Terraform-specific and Python-related files. In Azure DevOps, I configured the repository with the appropriate .gitignore settings. To reference the parent folder in the template, I used the python_source variable as ../src. I validated this configuration locally on my laptop, ensuring everything was set up correctly.
